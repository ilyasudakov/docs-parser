Differences between deprecation and sunset Term Deprecation Sunset Definition The deprecated version is a version that is not the latest one . Once a new version is released, all previous versions will be marked deprecated. The sunset version can no longer be used . Requests sent to this version will fail on or after the sunset date. Implication You can still use the deprecated versions until they're sunset , but the references of the deprecated versions are de-highlighted to show that they're not the latest version anymore. We encourage you to upgrade to the latest version as soon as possible to benefit from new features. You need to upgrade from the sunset versions immediately in order to use the Google Ads API. We highly recommend that you upgrade to the latest version , using the upgrade guide .

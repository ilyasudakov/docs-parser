Versioned changes typically apply to the newest version immediately and often will apply to other versions at a future date. The changelog accompanying each release indicates which changes apply to the current release and which changes apply to other versions.\nRefer to our\nUpgrade Guide\nto learn how to upgrade to a new API version.\nOut-Of-Cycle Changes\nOut-of-cycle changes are changes introduced outside of our normal, versioned release schedule and typically do not apply to a specific version. Instead, out-of-cycle changes usually apply to all API versions immediately. Because of this, out-of-cycle changes are introduced infrequently.\nAvailable Graph API Versions\nVersion\nDate Introduced\nAvailable Until\nv22.0\nJanuary 21, 2025\nTBD\nv21.0\nOctober 2, 2024\nTBD\nv20.0\nMay 21, 2024\nSeptember 24, 2026\nv19.0\nJanuary 23, 2024\nMay 21, 2026\nv18.0\nSeptember 12, 2023\nJanuary 26, 2026\nv17.0\nMay 23, 2023\nSeptember 12, 2025\nv16.0\nFebruary 2, 2023\nMay 14, 2025\nv15.0\nSeptember 15, 2022\nNovember 20, 2024\nv14.0\nMay 25, 2022\nSeptember 17, 2024\nv13.0\nFebruary 8, 2022\nMay 28, 2024\nAvailable Marketing API Versions\nMarketing API\nversion auto-upgrade\nwill release on May 14, 2024.\nVersion\nDate Introduced\nAvailable Until\nv22.0\nJanuary 21, 2025\nTBD\nv21.0\nOctober 2, 2024\nTBD\nv20.0\nMay 21, 2024\nMay 6, 2025\nv19.0\nJanuary 23, 2024\nFebruary 4, 2025\nOut-Of-Cycle Changes\n2023 out-of-cycle changes"
